### 05/05 - 11/05/2025
- Built API endpoints for getDetailHotel
  - Implemented the endpoint GET /hotels/{hotelId} to retrieve detailed information of a specific hotel.

  - This endpoint returns a structured ApiResponse<HotelResponse> containing the full detail of the hotel entity, including images, location, price, and category.

  - Integrated the endpoint with service layer hotelServiceImp.getOneHotel(hotelId) to encapsulate business logic and database interaction.

  - Ensured the endpoint is RESTful and supports standard HTTP status codes for success and failure scenarios.
- Handle Exception!!
  - Create a custom exception that includes predefined error codes.
